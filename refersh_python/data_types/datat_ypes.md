### Most Common Python Data Types

- int	        Integer numbers (no decimal)	                        age = 30
- float	        Decimal numbers	                                        price = 19.99
- str	        Text (string of characters)	                            name = "Win"
- bool	        Boolean values: True or False	                        is_exist = True
- list	        Ordered, mutable collection	                            colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]
- tuple 	    Ordered, immutable collection	                        point = (10, 20)
- dict	        Key-value pairs, like a mini database	                user = {"name": "Win", "age": 30}
- set	        Unordered collection of unique items	                tags = {"python", "django", "go"}
- NoneType	    Represents the absence of a value	                    result = None

### Pythonic Use Cases
- list and dict are probably the most used in real-world apps—especially for APIs, configs, and data manipulation.
- str is everywhere—logging, user input, file handling.
- bool is key for control flow (if, while, etc.).
- set is great for removing duplicates or fast membership checks.
- tuple often shows up in unpacking and function returns.
